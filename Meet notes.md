# Meet notes
1. Need of simulators for reinforcement learning
2. Stereo cams - (COGNIS) purpose - mount on the car agv
	1. circuit
	2. blackfly stereo cams
	3. availability
	4. options
3. Zed camera with IMU PR. (Intel realsense is noisy) 120mm baseline with UV polarization lens. OR Cognix  (stereo pairs)
	1. monocular camera with good shutter.
4. Gaussian's splatting SLAM - for dense mapping and help to bring them in simulators
5. No **RnD** on hardware.
6. Focus on Outdoor Car AGV.
7. ready to use sensors.


AGV - Medicine supply.
level for abilities - outdoor cars


1. humanoid
2. drones
3. AGV outdoor / indoor
	1. Indoor
		1. Z cam instead of intel realsense 
	2. Outdoor
		1. Sensor integration - standard basic sensor of car
		2. Procuring those sensors
		3. Mounting it on the CAR
