# Section 6 - ROS2 services
## 49. Intro
The two most important communication features in ROS 2 are Topics and Services.
Topics are used for data streams, and Services for a client/server interaction.
At the end of this section you’ll be able to make your nodes communicate with ROS2 Services.
Here’s what you’ll do:

- Understand what ROS Services are, and when to use them, thanks to a real life analogy.
    
- Write your own Service (client + server) in both Python and C++.
    
- Introspect Services from the terminal.
    
- Experiment on Turtlesim.
